Steps for launc and run packages and nodes 

first step is to setup URSIM:	


Step 1: Setup URSIM

1: Open URSIM with admin privileges
	cd ~/ursim-3.15.4.106291
	sudo ./start-ursim.sh UR10

2: Wait for it to finish opening, and click through all the error messages, then close it.

3: reopen without admin privs
	./start-ursim.sh UR10

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Second step is launch ur_robot_drivers:


Step 2: UR-Ros drivers

In a new terminal (control + shift + T)
 use provided launch file
	This launch file needs to be edited, but once edited, you can use it easily.
	To Edit: 
		gedit ~/catkin_ws/src/robot_control_simulation/launch/ur_robot_drivers.launch
			change the "robot_ip" parameter to match the URSIM's IP
	To launch:
		roslaunch robot_control_simulation ur_robot_drivers.launch


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After make sure that ursim is run in new terminal

roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

final step in another terminal launch the file:

roslaunch my_simulations server_robots.launch 

this is the launch file to launch the server to run the three nodes one is controller, one is turtlebot move, and one is for ur10_move.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


in case you want to check ur10_move or turtlebot code 

run it separate
	
		rosrun my_simulations turtlebot_move
		
		rosrun my_simulations grippin_ur10s
